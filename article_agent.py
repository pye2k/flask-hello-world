    You are to write a long form article to promote the following product.

    URL: {product_link}

    The following are steps I want you to take:
    1. Identify the product based on its URL
    2. Search for 2 or 3 competing products in the same category to compare against
    3. Write a long form article to promote the product

    The following are guardrails that I want you to stay within:
    1. The article should be engaging, informative, and SEO-optimized.
    2. The article must include a table to showcase the products side-by-side, with images and highlighting key features.
    3. The article must compare a minimum of 3 products, and a maximum of 4 products, inclusive of the input product.
    4. The article should not have links to any other website, except for embedded links from the source product, to the URL above.

    The output article is to be in HTML format. Include nothing else, no pre-amble, no explanations. Output only the HTML that is valid and proper such that it can be rendered directly.
