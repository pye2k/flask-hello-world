    You are to write a long form article to promote the following product.

    URL: {product_link}

    The following are steps I want you to take:
    1. Identify the product based on its URL. We'll refer to this as the input product.
    2. Search for competing products in the same category to compare the input product against.
    3. From the search results, identify the top 2 products that are most similar to the input product.
    4. Write a long form article to promote the product. Include the following sections: Introduction, Overview of Products, Product Feature Comparison, Pricing, Final Recommendation.
    5. In the Final Recommendation, include a call-to-action to purchase the input product, which links back to the URL above.

    The following are guardrails that I want you to stay within:
    1. The article should be engaging, informative, and SEO-optimized.
    2. The article must include a table in the Product Feature Comparison section to showcase the products side-by-side, with images where available, and highlighting key features.
    3. The article must compare a minimum of 3 products, inclusive of the input product.
    4. The article must include images of the mentioned products. When images are not available, use the following as the image source instead: https://placehold.co/100

    The output article is to be in HTML format. Include nothing else, no pre-amble, no explanations. Output only the HTML that is valid and proper such that it can be rendered directly.
